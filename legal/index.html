      <p>
        LightKey is an accessibility initiative of <a href="https://glasscase.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GlassCase.org</a>. It publishes pathway guides that break down legal processes into plain-language steps, and position papers on legal accessibility and governance.
      </p>
      <p>
        These materials are educational resources. They are not legal, financial or professional advice. Pathway guides describe how processes generally work under Commonwealth legislation. Position papers analyse legal and governance issues. Neither tell you what to do in your situation, and they cannot account for the specific facts of your case, changes in the law, or agency-specific practices that may affect your experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this site does not create a solicitor-client or advisory relationship. If you need advice about your situation, please seek independent advice from a qualified professional in your jurisdiction. For authoritative FOI guidance, see the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/freedom-of-information/foi-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OAIC FOI Guidelines</a>.

      <h2 id="s5">Privacy, analytics &amp; cookies</h2>
      <p>
        This site uses <a href="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Analytics</a> and <a href="https://ahrefs.com/analytics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs Analytics</a> to understand aggregate traffic and usage patterns. We do not use these tools for advertising or behavioural profiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        These services use cookies and similar technologies to collect information such as page views, referrers, approximate location, device and browser information and IP addresses. We use this information in aggregate to understand how the site is used and to improve the content. We do not sell personal data, combine analytics data with other data to profile named individuals, or attempt to re-identify people from analytics data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The site works even if you block cookies or JavaScript in your browser. If you would prefer not to be tracked, you can manage or block cookies through your browser settings and extensions. Nothing will break.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you contact us, we will take reasonable steps to delete or de-identify any logs we can associate with you, subject to technical limits and legal record-keeping requirements. These providers may process information on servers outside Australia (for example, in the United States or the European Union). You can learn more in their own privacy materials:

      </ul>
      <p>
        We process analytics data on the basis of legitimate interests (<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-6-gdpr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDPR Article 6(1)(f)</a>) — specifically, our interest in understanding how the site is used so we can maintain and improve it. Under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A03712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian Privacy Act</a>, this collection falls within the "reasonably expected" secondary purpose exception (<a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/australian-privacy-principles/australian-privacy-principles-guidelines/chapter-6-app-6-use-or-disclosure-of-personal-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener">APP 6.2(a)</a>). We have conducted a legitimate interests assessment and determined that this processing is proportionate, minimally intrusive, and does not override the rights and freedoms of data subjects. The data collected does not include special category data, is not used for profiling, and is processed in aggregate form.
      </p>
      <p>
        We maintain internal governance records including a legitimate interests assessment, a record of processing activities and a data subject rights handling procedure. These are available on request to any supervisory authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Google Analytics does not load unless you explicitly accept via the cookie consent banner on your first visit. The default state is decline — no GA data is collected unless you opt in. You can withdraw consent at any time via the "Cookie Settings" link in the footer, or by blocking cookies through your browser settings or extensions such as uBlock Origin or Privacy Badger. Ahrefs Analytics loads on every page visit regardless of consent; it collects no cookies and no personal data (see the <a href="https://ahrefs.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ahrefs Privacy Policy</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        We access and use analytics data in aggregate form only. Google Analytics event data is retained for 14 months. Ahrefs operates as an independent data controller; we do not retain personal data from Ahrefs — see their privacy policy above for their own retention practices. Contact form submissions and inbox correspondence are retained for up to 24 months, unless an ongoing professional relationship exists. Contact forms on this site are processed by <a href="https://formspree.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formspree</a>, which acts as a data processor on our behalf (<a href="https://formspree.io/legal/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Formspree Privacy Policy</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each site we operate (glasscase.org, lightkey.org, lawandlearning.com, jayspudvilas.com) uses its own separate Google Analytics property. There is no cross-domain tracking and no cross-site aggregation of analytics data.
      </p>

        Although the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/privacy/notifiable-data-breaches/about-the-notifiable-data-breaches-scheme" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Notifiable Data Breaches scheme</a> under <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A03712" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Part IIIC of the Privacy Act</a> may not apply to this project directly, we voluntarily commit to notifying affected users of any significant data breach that we become aware of and that is likely to affect their personal information.

      <p>
        This site is not directed at children under 16, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

      <p>
        You can contact us to ask what personal information, if any, we hold about you. If you believe any personal information we hold about you is inaccurate, you can contact us to request correction. If you believe we have handled your personal information in a way that breaches your privacy, you can contact us to make a complaint and we will respond within 30 days.

        The site is designed with particular attention to users who process information differently, including people with dyslexia, anxiety and cognitive fatigue. Design choices include clear structure, wide spacing, still pages with no animations, readable typography, and colour-coded steps so you always know what kind of information you are looking at.

        We aim to support screen readers, keyboard navigation, and browser-based assistive technologies. The site is designed to work without JavaScript enabled.

        LightKey is developed through structured consultation with accessibility advocates, neurodivergent people and legal practitioners.
